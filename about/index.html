		Hi! My name is Lucas and welcome to my personal site and blog. I graduated from Boston University where I studied mathematics and computer science. My interests encompass everything from theoretical mathematics to theoretical computer science to machine learning.

		Throughout my academic career I've always wanted to understand everything I've learned at a deep level, and it was my Algebra professor in university that made me realize that to truly understand something you should be able to explain it in an intuitive way. Moreover, I've always thought it would be cool to write blog posts on topics that I find interesting, but never really had the time to while in school. So in order to fulfill this goal, as well as ensure I understand the material I've learned well enough I decided it was time to start writing some posts.

		I recently started working for BlackRock in New York as an Analyst in their Portfolio Analytics Group. There I am currently developing interesting NLP applications and other tools for internal teams and portfolio managers to use. I previously interned with the same group at BlackRock, as well as PWC, within their tech consulting group.
